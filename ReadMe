This program implements a hash table dynamically in order to test the efficiency of two 
different algorithms for resolving collisions: linear probing , and quadratic probing. 

To use this program:
	1. Place lprobe1.cpp and idata in the directory of your choice.

	2. Navigate to the directory in the terminal of your choice

	3. Compile lprobe1.cpp using:

			g++ lprobe1.cpp

	3. Run the program with the following arguments:

			./a.out <input_file_name> <probing_option> <load_factor>

			where:	<input_file_name> 	= 	idata (or the input file of your choice)
					<probing_option> 	=	0 (for linear probing)
											1 (for quadratic probing)
					<load_factor>		=	a floating point value between 0.1 and .99

			An example command line execution would be:

					./a.out idata 0 .5
